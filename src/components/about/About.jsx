        As a Marketing major, I graduated from Baruch college on the deanâ€™s list. I enjoyed marketing but I was always curious about software development.</p> 
        <p>The flexibility, the creativity, and the love for coffee intrigued me. Learning how to develop has been fun and I look forward to keep learning and growing.
